        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>

        <h4>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h4>
        <p>
          When people are told that intelligence is not fixed and that it is possible to become 'smarter' through effort, they are more likely to put effort in rather than just give up when they are faced with a difficult problem.
        </p>

        <h4>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h4>
        <p>
          Trying not to get frustrated when I can't do something right straight away. Focus on achieving incremental steps rather than the end goal.
        </p>

        <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
        <p>
          According to the internet, getting enough sleep, exercising and reducing stress all help with neuroplasticity. Also engaging in activities that stimulate the brain like playing music, video games or learning a new language. In summary, getting out of your comfort zone causes your brain to make new neural pathways and improves your neuroplasticity.
        </p>

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>

        <h4>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h4>
        <p>
          Having a growth mindset means believing you can get better at something. It means you are open to challenges and new ideas, and if you don't initially succeed at something you still believe you'll be able to do it one day if you keep trying. By contrast if you have a fixed mindset you believe that intelligence/ability is fixed, so if you don't succeed at something you are likely to believe you're inherently bad at it and not try to get better.
        </p>

        <h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>
        <p>
          I thought it was interesting how Carol Dweck said in her <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-459099" target="_blank">TED talk</a> that you shouldn't praise children for their intelligence/talent, but instead should praise the 'process' of getting there. For example, praising strategy, improvement etc. It made me think that people like myself who were always one of the 'brainy' kids at school are probably less likely to naturally develop a growth mindset growing up. Perhaps being praised for being smart as a kid has contributed to my tendency to beat myself up when I make a mistake? I wonder if someone that school came less easily to and who had to learn to overcome challenges when they were young might be more likely to have developed a growth mindset in relation to learning. 
        </p>

        <h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>
        <p>
          I think it is important for me to be aware of when I am getting frustrated or annoyed at myself for not being able to do something. I need to remind myself that it is a step in a journey, that we learn from our mistakes, and that if I keep trying I will get there eventually. I need to make a conscious effort to correct myself if I find myself telling myself I can't do something.

          I found this video absolutely fascinating. In it, Dr Andrew Huberman explains what goes on in your brain when you are in a growth mindset, and how to trigger neuroplasticity. If you're like me and you love understanding what makes things work, this is well worth a watch.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the key takeaways from this video is that you can train your brain to release dopamine (a neurochemical that makes you feel good) <em>in pursuit of goals</em>, not just for achieving them. Having a growth mindset is essentially the process of attaching these dopamine rewards to <em>effort</em>, instead of just the end result. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The trick is to tell yourself you're on the right track, or that you have achieved a step along the way. One way to do this is by setting small milestones. When you achieve them, pause for a moment and tell yourself you are heading in the right direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The release of dopamine also helps to compensate for the tiring effect of stress-related neurochemicals. So there is a lot to be gained from cultivating a growth mindset!
        </p>


        <h3>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h3>

        <h4>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy</h4>
        <p>
          I will try to identify and celebrate achieving milestones along the way, rather than just the end goal. If I find myself getting frustrated, I will try to take a step back and approach the problem with a growth mindset by breaking it down into smaller, achievable goals.
