        <h3>A time I got blocked on a simple problem</h3>

        <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
        <p>
          During Sprint 2, we learnt about the basic programming languages that are used to build websites, and built our own website to put our new skills into practice. I had never used these languages before, so I found building my website quite difficult. At one point, I decided I wanted to make a picture appear in the middle of the page, a task which on the face of it sounded fairly achievable. However, after trying for half an hour, I just couldn't get it to work!
        </p>

        <h4>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h4>
        <p>
          Trial and error, googling the problem, and asking a friend who's a developer.
        </p>

        <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
        <p>
          I felt quite frustrated for taking so long to figure out what I thought was going to be a simple problem. When I eventually managed to make it work, I felt pleased with myself for persevering (although I also realised it perhaps had not been the best use of my time!)
        </p>

        <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
        <p>
          If I find myself getting stuck, I should take a step back and do something else for a while and then come back to it rather than continuing to go around in circles. 
        </p>

        <h3>A time when I solved a problem in an elegant way</h3>

        <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
        <p>
          When I first started working as a trainee patent attorney, I had no way to keep track of the work that was given to me. I had lots of different tasks with different priorities given to me by different people, and I quickly started losing track.
        </p> 

        <h4>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h4>
        <p>
          I asked around, and was given a copy of a work tracking spreadsheet that another junior had put together. While this was a good starting point, I couldn't easily tell from looking at the list of tasks which one I needed to work on first. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I put my thinking cap on and came up with a series of rules for determining how urgent a task was (for example, what type of work it was, whether it was currently with me or someone else, what date I had been asked to complete it by, and what the actual deadline was). I then implemented those rules in my spreadsheet so that tasks would have different colours depending on their urgency. Finally, I added a button that automatically sorted the tasks from most to least urgent when you clicked on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time I continued to improve my spreadsheet as I noticed things that weren't behaving quite as I wanted them to, or when I came up with ideas for new rules that would be helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there was a fairly complicated set of rules in the background, the spreadsheet itself was simple to use and the visual representation of task urgency helped me quickly prioritise my work. It was well worth the time I invested early on for the time it saved me in the long run! 
        </p>



        <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
        <p>
          I got a huge sense of satisfaction every time I figured out why something wasn't working and fixed it, or when I successfully implemented a new feature. I found tinkering around with my spreadsheet a fun distraction from my actual job and would have to make sure I didn't spend too much time on it! (In retrospect this might have been a bit of a sign...)
        </p>

        <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
        <p>
          I learnt that there's always something you can improve, but sometimes you have to stop once it's good enough and get on with other things!
        </p>

        <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem solving techniques/processes</h3>

        <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
        <p>
          I tried using psuedocode during the JavaScript katas and found my actual code didn't really align with it. I'm confident that I understand the concept of psuedocode but I think I need more practice at the execution.
        </p>

        <h4>Trying something</h4>
        <p>
          I'm pretty good at figuring things out by trial and error. If I'm using a function or method I'm not familiar with I will often skim the documentation to get the gist of how it works, then test it in my code to see what actually happens.
        </p>

        <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
        <p>
          I understand the idea of the rubber ducky method but I haven't tried it myself. That said, I do sometimes talk to myself when I'm stuck on a problem (a terrible side effect of too much working from home!) So perhaps that counts...
        </p>

        <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
        <p>
          I'm fairly confident with reading error messages. They usually at least point you towards the line(s) where things are going wrong, even if it's not super clear from the error message what the problem actually is.
        </p>

        <h4>Console.logging</h4>
        <p>
          I'm very confident with console.logging and I use it all the time when solving coding challenges. 
        </p>

        <h4>Googling</h4>
        <p>
          I'm very confident with Googling. I think I have just enough previous coding experience that I usually have a pretty good idea of what to search for.
        </p>

        <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
        <p>
          I'm confident with this in an in-person setting (like a workplace). I find it a bit more difficult using a platform like Slack because I feel like I first need to check if the question has already been asked, so it's a bit more effort.
        </p>

        <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
        <p>
          I'm very confident with asking coaches for help. It's great to be able to learn from people that know more than you!
        </p>

        <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
        <p>
          I'm reasonably confident with this. I don't necessarily make a conscious effort to reflect, but I think my perfectionistic tendencies automatically make me think about what I could do better next time.
        </p>
