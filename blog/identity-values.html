          <h3>Describe your core personal values</h3>
          <p>I think my core values are curiosity, integrity, fairness and determination.</p>
          <p>I am curious about the world around me and love discovering explanations for things and finding out how things work.</p>
          <p>I pride myself on doing what I say I'll do. I am a very honest person with a strong moral compass.</p>
          <p>I have a strong sense of justice, and hate to see people treated unfairly.</p>
          <p>I am very determined, and tend to believe that not being naturally good at something doesn't mean I shouldn't try - it just means I have to work harder to get there.</p>
          <h4>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h4>
          <p>I struggled to come up with an answer to this question that I felt comfortable publishing online. I briefly considered making something up or using a situation that a friend had been in so that I could complete the exercise, which ironically was an ethical dilemma of sorts. However, I felt that would be dishonest. If necessary for assessment purposes, I would be happy to discuss this in person.</p>
          <h4>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h4>
          <p>I'm a fifth-generation Pākehā New Zealander. I grew up in a family where I was taught that girls could do anything, and went on to study mechanical engineering.  I also grew up around people, particularly my dad and sister, with strong principles and a real desire to want to make the word a better place. Both of them work in roles where they make a tangible difference to people's lives. Like them, I have a strong sense of justice and would like to be doing something that makes a difference, but at this point in time I don't feel like have an avenue to direct that energy. I'm hoping that I will be able to use the skills I gain at Dev Academy to make a difference somewhere!</p>
          <h3>Describe your strengths and limitations</h3>
          <h4>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h4>
          <p>A key strength is that I am good at problem solving. I love solving problems and building solutions. I am also extremely good at spotting patterns. My partner refuses to to jigsaw puzzles with me because I'm too quick and I'll spot the piece he's be searching for for 10 minutes within a few seconds. I love making sense of data and turning it into something useful (I have a spreadsheet for everything!) I think this strength will be extremely useful for helping me quickly pick up the Dev Academy content.</p>
          <p>The flipside of this strength is that I can sometimes get tunnel vision and spend too long trying to solve a problem in a particular way rather than taking a step back, having a break and considering it from another angle. This is definitely something I need to be conscious of when learning to code, as I imagine this kind of situation comes up quite often.</p>
          <p>Another strength is that I am very driven. I am very motivated to work hard when there is a clear end goal, which will definitely help me get through my learning journey at Dev Academy.</p>
          <p>Another strength/weakness (depending on how you look at it) is perfectionism. I think this can go both ways. Sometimes it is very useful to have the ability to be thorough and precise. I think attention to detail can be a constructive way in which perfectionism manifests itself. Other times, the desire for perfection can make a task take too long. I need to be mindful of when my perfectionism is helping me and when it is hindering.</p>
          <p>Another weakness is lack of self confidence. I don't always lack self-confidence, but I think it takes me longer than the average person to gain confidence in something (perhaps this ties in with my perfectionism). I don't do well with being thrown in the deep end and need time to prepare before encountering an unfamiliar situation. This is more likely to affect me in a professional context, as I feel like a learning environment like Dev Academy is a safe space where it's OK not to know things, and where you can try new things without too much fear of failure.</p>
          <p>Another strength is that I really like learning. I get a buzz and feel really good about myself when I grasp a new concept. I'm also quite a fast learner, which can quickly create a positive feedback loop when I am in a learning environment. I was quite proud of myself on the first day of Dev Academy when I figured out how to upgrade from WSL 1 to WSL 2, which wasn't entirely straightforward and took a bit of googling!</p>
          <p>The flipside of this strength is that I tend to get bored if I'm not being challenged my new things on a fairly regular basis. I don't think this will be a problem during Dev Academy though!</p>
          <h4>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h4>
          <p>I think all of the strengths discussed above will help me in my learning journey at Dev Academy. Enjoying learning and being driven by the end goal of finding a new, more satisfying job will help motivate me to work. My problem solving and pattern spotting abilities, as well as my attention to detail will help me get through the work and pick up new concepts quickly.</p>
          <h4>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h4>
          <p>I haven't done a lot of team work in recent years, but during my masters degree (2014) I took charge of a whole class project (there were 24 of us in the class) to produce a booklet about business research. There was also a deputy project manager and the rest of the class split into groups that worked on different parts of the booklet. I also had an editing team that was primarily responsible for pulling the whole thing together into a cohesive document at the end.</p>
          <p>The main issue was that about two thirds of the class were straight out of undergrad and for the most part they didn't take the course as seriously as those of us who had been out in the real world and decided to come back to study. Despite regular checkins to see how each group was going, a lot of people didn't really seem to care and several of the groups handed in very poor quality work to the editing team.</p>
          <p>One of the strategies I used was to make sure the editing team had people on it who would be motivated to do a good job. This ultimately led to a high quality result, but they ended up doing a disproportionate amount of the overall work due the the quality of the work that was given to them. Having a deputy project manager was also a successful strategy, as it was really helpful to have someone to bounce ideas off.</p>
          <p>Looking back on it I should have anticipated the apathy of most of the students to doing yet another assignment. (I guess the underlying lesson here is that just because you are enthusiastic and motivated about something, it doesn't mean those around you are!) If I was doing this again now, I would try to set clearer expectations about the expected standard of work. I would also get each team to give their work to the editing team much earlier so that substandard work back could be sent back to the teams to fix.</p>
