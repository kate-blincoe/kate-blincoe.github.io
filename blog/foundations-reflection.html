        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          I learnt that I would much rather be coding than thinking about my feelings. I realise that the core work is important, but that didn't stop me from procrastinating and always starting on the tech stuff first!
        </p>
        <p>
          I found one of the hardest, but also most valuable, exercises was the one on personal values, as this wasn't something I'd really thought about before. Identifying my core values as curiosity, integrity, fairness and determination helped give me a better understanding of why I act the way I do in certain situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also learnt that I might have relatively low EQ, but the good news is that this can apparently be improved with the right training!
        </p>
        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>
          Your values can provide motivation for doing what you're doing. This is important when it comes to learning and programming, as having an end goal guided by your values can help motivate you when things get tough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empathy and self-awareness are really important when it comes to working well with others. Despite the stereotype of the lone coder sitting in his basement, in the real world programming is usually a team sport and a lack of empathy and self-awareness would make teamwork a challenge!
        </p>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          I was most surprised by how familiar most of it was and how easily I could relate it back to previous experiences. There wasn't much of the core learning that was completely new to me, but it was useful to build on my existing knowledge.
        </p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          The personal values part, and also trying to stick to my commitment to do 10 minutes of meditation a day.
        </p>
        <h3>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>
          Because technical skills won't get you very far if you can't work well with others. Also, having good self-awareness and knowing how to cope with stress and difficult situations is really important for looking after your mental health and being happy in your job.
        </p>

        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>
          I definitely wanted to spend more time practicing programming! But that said I think the core content is really valuable and a good use of time. As the name suggests, you need those 'core' skills as a foundation for all the technical skills to sit on top of.
