          <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
          <p>Emotional intelligence is basically what it says on the tin. It's a measure of your ability to understand and deal with emotions (both your own and other peoples). There are different theories about exactly how to quantify and measure emotional intelligence, but I thought <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-emotional-intelligence-2795423" target="_blank">this article</a> summed it up quite well:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Perceiving emotions</li>
            <li>Reasoning with emotions</li>
            <li>Understanding emotions</li>
            <li>Managing emotions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I did <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-emotionally-intelligent-are-you-2796099" target="_blank">this test</a>, which told me I had low emotional intelligence. I was a bit surprised by this. It's not that I think I have particularly high EQ, but I thought I would at least score a medium! Anyway, the good news is that emotional intelligence can apparently be improved with the right training.</p>
          <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
          <p>IQ is a measure of cognitive ability but does not capture a person's ability to interact with other humans. Unlike EQ, there isn't a lot you can do to change your IQ.</p> 
          <p>EQ and IQ measure completely different things, and there doesn't seem to be any consensus about whether they are related - the top three Google results say (1) that IQ is inversely proportional to EQ, (2) that there is no relation between IQ and EQ, and (3) that IQ and EQ are closely linked!</p>
          <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
          <p>Pretty much everything we do in life involves other people. If you can't play nicely with others, you are going to find it a lot more difficult to succeed professionally, as well as in your personal life, than someone with a high EQ.</p>
