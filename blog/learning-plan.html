          <h3>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h3>
          <p>This is an update from the <a href=#foundations>Foundations Learning Plan</a> I originally posted a few weeks ago. Most of the information in that learning plan is still accurate, so this updated plan just adds a bit more detail.</p>
          <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
          <p>I'm hoping to use the skills I gain during this course to get a job I enjoy at a company with a good culture and good work-life balance. I would like to work for a company that does some good in the world and feel like I am contributing to that. I don't intend to leave Wellington, so I would like to find a job that is either based in Wellington or a remote job that can be based anywhere.</p>
          <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
          <p>I think the strengths and limitations I discussed in my initial post are still accurate, and I haven't really discovered any new ones during Foundations.</p>
          <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
          <p>I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be managing my time. It was tricky early on in Foundations balancing my time with having a new puppy. That's getting easier now, but I'm sure the change of routine brought on by Bootcamp will bring new challenges.</p>
          <p>In addition to dealing with the demands of the puppy, I got behind in Sprint 2 due to a family emergency and needed an extension. I managed to make up the time over the subsequent sprints by having a plan and being mindful of how I spent my time (for example, deciding not to do a stretch exercise because I had already spent the timebox limit on the original challenge, or deciding not to fix something that wasn't quite perfect because it was already good enough.) I think these will be useful skills to bring into Bootcamp, where I understand we will be working to fairly short deadlines and I expect I will often need to make decisions about how best to spend the time available.</p>
          <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
          <p>I would like to develop my teamwork skills as this is something I haven't had a lot of practice at in recent years. I think pair programming will be a good way to help develop those skills.</p>
          <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
          <p>I expect the Bootcamp team to support me by giving me constructive feedback. If there is a better way of doing something that a more experienced programmer would have done, I would like them to let me know so I can learn for next time. If any issues come up, I expect that they will support me by working together to come up with a solution.</p>
          <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
          <p>If I need help, I will ask Google, ask my fellow students, or ask the Bootcamp team (in that order). </p>
          <p>I will manage my work by having a plan of what I am going to achieve and when. If I find myself getting behind, I will stop and reassess the situation, and discuss with my team-mates and/or Bootcamp staff as required.</p><br>


          <h3 id="foundations">Foundations Learning Plan</h3>
          <p>This my original Foundations learning plan, originally posted on 15 February.</p>
          <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
          <p>My long term goal is to be working in a job that I find challenging and fun, and that has a flexible working environment that suits my lifestyle. At this stage I think I am more interested in back-end development, but I hope to discover more about what areas of web development really interest me as I progress through Dev Academy.</p>
          <h4>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h4>
          <p>I am a perfectionist and I hate leaving things unfinished. This is both a strength and a weakness. The drive to finish things can be very helpful when it comes to completing tasks. However, it can also mean that I can take too long trying to complete something when I would be better to leave it and move on.</p>
          <p>An example of this is when I sat down to write this learning plan. Before I started I had a look at the progress I made on my website yesterday. I didn't like how my About page looked and I thought to myself, "<em>if I could just center the image it would look a ton better - and it's nothing fancy so it shouldn't be too hard!</em>" But then I couldn't get it to work, and half an hour in I felt like I couldn't give up, because I had already spent so much time on it. So I stuck at it and 45 minutes after I started managed to achieve what I wanted using a very inelegant solution, that may well cause issues later.</p>
          <p>In retrospect I should have stopped about 15 minutes in when I wasn't getting anywhere. So in this case my perfectionism was very unhelpful!</p>
          <p>Another strength is that I enjoy learning and I pick up new concepts quickly. However, I don't retain information in my head very well, so I find I need to take notes to refer back to later. This has made working my way through tutorials slower than it otherwise would be. However, so far I have found the notes I've been making extremely helpful for building my blog website so I think they save me time in the long run.</p>
          <h4>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
          <p>I would like to become better at accepting constructive criticism as I can sometimes take criticism a bit too personally.</p>
          <h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h4>
          <p>I will set a plan each week for what I plan to achieve and when I am going to achieve it. I will endeavour to stick to the time estimates and if I find myself exceeding the suggested time, I will stop and reassess.</p>
          <p>If I find myself getting behind, I will try to prioritise the most important things. I will try to be mindful of my perfectionistic tendencies and keep reminding myself that it's OK if things aren't quite finished or not as good as I would like them.</p>
          <p>If I find myself getting really behind, or something unexpected comes up, I will let my facilitator know and come up with a plan together if necessary. </p>
          <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
          <p>If I find myself getting stuck and I can't find the answer on Google, I will make use of the #Foundations Slack channel and hopefully one of my fellow students will be able to help!</p>
          <h4>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h4>
          <p>I expect the facilitation team to give me honest feedback on how I'm going. If any issues come up, I expect that we will be able to work together to come up with a solution.</p>
          <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
          <p>I play in a couple of bands in my spare time and I would like to keep going along to rehearsals if I can. However, I have let them know that my availability might be limited over the next few months. Most of our upcoming gigs have been cancelled anyway due to covid so that takes the pressure off too.</p>
          <p>We also have a young puppy at home. Once the in-person Bootcamp starts, I might have to leave quite promptly at the end of the day to get home and look after her. I will be able to keep working from home in the evenings though so I don't think this will have too much impact on my ability to get my work done.</p>
